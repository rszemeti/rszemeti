- 👋 Hi, I’m @rszemeti
- 👀 I’m interested electronics, especially microwave radio. I trained as an electronics engineer, but my skillset includes mechanical engineering and basic electrochemistry.  I can do a reasonable impression of a competent software engineer. I have a small mechanical workshop with some basic CNC machining and a fully equipped RF workbench with most features up to 26.5 GHz.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make plated-through-hole prototype PCBs in my kitchen.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting microwave radio projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
